# Pollution_Prediction_ML_Ericsson
ML Hackathon 2019 by Ericsson

## Dataset
Reports on the weather and the level of pollution each hour for five years

## Goal
- Unlock further possibilities and benefits
- Send alarms to people who work outside
  Smart home air systems could decide, for example, if windows must be closed for the next few hours
